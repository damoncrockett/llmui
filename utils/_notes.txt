- Sometimes the selection gets one off, (or even more off) --- not after a result; I mean right after you click and drag. The selection added to state is simple not what was selected

- Lots of issues are periods and spaces
  - you REALLY need to be able to edit the text like normal

- Maybe include a mode for visual language, to use for prompting DALL-E

- Right now the 'new' prompt only works if there is something preceding the selection (since it takes that as its prompt)

- Occasionally, the selection simply doesn't update in time
  - I guess React is waiting to actually update the state
